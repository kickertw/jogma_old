		<b><u>Removal of "non-graduates"</u></b><br>
		To popular demand a new function has been added.  Any graduations list that had students that did not officially graduate can be backed out.
		Backing out means that their rank will be restored to thier last graduation, credit will be given to your schools account, and they will be removed from that graduation list.
		This option is relative only to finalized lists.

		<b><u>Old Graduation History</u></b><br>
		Old graduation histories, prior to the inception of JOGMA, are now online.  When clicking on a student, 
		you should be able to see that person's full history.  If a particular student's history is not showing up, 
		please contact Master Wong.

		<b><u>Attention Instructors</u></b><br>
		In order to better manage the diploma process, the pricing and quantities have changed as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>Purchasing blank diplomas = $25 each diploma</li>
			<li>Able to purchase in sets of (5)</li>
			<li>Processing a graduation = $1 each graduate</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Since some schools still have blanks that were purchased for $1, you will need to return those for a full credit, and apply that credit toward future diploma purchases.  Processing graduations with mixed diploma purchases will not be possible. We appreciate your patience as we work to improve this system for everone.</p>
